# Task 4 - Aggregate Functions and Grouping

## Objective
Analyze sales data using SQL aggregate functions with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench 

## Work Summary
- Designed a sales table with customer, category, quantity, price, and order date.
- Used aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) for total sales, averages, and order counts.
- Grouped data by product category and by month for better insights.
- Applied `HAVING` to filter categories exceeding a sales threshold.
- Counted distinct customers for unique buyer statistics.

## Key Learnings
- Aggregate functions summarize numeric data efficiently.
- `GROUP BY` is used for categorizing results.
- `HAVING` filters aggregated results.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT)` helps find the number of unique records.
